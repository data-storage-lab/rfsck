This repository consists source code of e2fsprogs (v1.43.6) along with our REDO LOG source code. The source code for REDO LOG is added in ./lib/ext2fs folder. 

Currently we have only modified e2fsck to utilize the REDO LOG with input option -r /path/to/redo_log. 

Other programs in e2fsprogs can be modified easily to utilize the REDO LOG. Kindly follow our template as used in e2fsck

================================================================================

Original README:

	This is the new version (1.43.6) of the second extended file
system management programs.

	From time to time, I release new versions of e2fsprogs, to fix
bugs and to make the utilities more robust.  You can always find
information about the latest version at the the e2fsprogs web page,
which is:

	http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net

	The INSTALL file has instructions on building and installing
e2fsprogs.  Provisions for building Red Hat RPMs and Debian dpkg files
are supplied as well.

	In case of bugs in these programs, please contact Ted Ts'o at
tytso@mit.edu or tytso@alum.mit.edu.  See the e2fsck man page for
suggestions of what sort of information to include when submitting bug
reports for these programs.
