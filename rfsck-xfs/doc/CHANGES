	  (thanks to Andreas Jochens).
	- Make xfs_db and xfs_repair cope with filesystems that
	  have project quota enabled.

xfsprogs-2.6.27 (23 March 2005)
	- Fix default mkfs allocation group size calculations
	  for filesystem sizes in the range 32 - 64 terabytes.
	- Add noalign mkfs suboptions for -d/-r to disable the
	  sunit/swidth auto-alignment (based on logical volume
	  geometry, extracted from the driver).

xfsprogs-2.6.26 (08 March 2005)
	- Fix compilation problem with version 4 of gcc
	  (thanks to Andreas Jochens).
	- Added a streamlined <xfs/xfs.h> for programs wanting
	  to make use of the XFS-specific kernel interfaces (to
	  address complaints that <xfs/libxfs.h> was "heavy").
	- Add imap as an expert command in xfs_io, making it
	  more easily accessible to those who need it.
	- Extended statistics reporting for xfs_io command.
	- Fixed readline support for current distributions.
	- Add an --enable-termcap=[yes/no] configure option,
	  and changed --enable-readline=[yes/no] to not force
	  linking with libtermcap.  Builds on some platforms
	  may need to use both options, but most distributions
	  do not require --enable-termcap when linking against
	  libreadline.
	- Minor man page updates.

xfsprogs-2.6.25 (08 October 2004)
	- Fix build with really old glibc versions.

	- Make xfs_io run any given command line commands (-c)
	  on all files specified, not just the first.

	- Add xfs_io write options to include fsync/fdatasync
	  in the timing results it displays.
	- Add xfs_fsop_counts output to the xfs_io statfs data,

	  all platforms again.
	- Minor man page updates fixing minus/hyphen usage.

xfsprogs-2.6.17 (23 June 2004)

	  function correctly in xfs_db and xfs_repair.
	- Fix initialisation of realtime devices in libxfs.

xfsprogs-2.6.16 (17 June 2004)
	- Add sendfile command into xfs_io(8) to exercise that
	  functionality.
	- Remove maxtrres program that was used in the build
	  to generate a header for mkfs' consumption.
	- This allows cross-compiles to be greatly simplified.
	- Portability tweaks for building on other platforms.
	- Fix obscure bug in log size lower boundary checks for
	  auto-sized logs when stripe alignment is in effect;
	  the enforced lower bound could have been set too low.

	- Make xfs_check test for a dirty log before proceeding to
	  check the filesystem.
	- Fix couple of minor bugs in xfs_io (readonly handling on
	  writes, off-by-one error in open file error reporting).

xfsprogs-2.6.14 (13 May 2004)
	- Allow logprint to copy a log to a file (-C) and to dump
	  a log from beginning to end showing ondisk log record (-d).
	- Fix logprint handling of -f option - shouldn't be doing
	  the UUID check in that case, since we don't have the SB.
	- Remove MD device superblock "clean" check, following Neil
	  Brown's advice.
	- Small Debian packaging tweak to say xfsprogs has an fsck.

xfsprogs-2.6.13 (03 May 2004)
	- Zero out more at beginning and end of device at mkfs time
	  (get all old MD superblocks at the end, for mount by label).

	- Sync up user/kernel source in libxfs and headers.
	- Fix compiler warnings on 64 bit platforms.
	- Update i18n message catalog.

xfsprogs-2.6.11 (15 April 2004)
	- Fix file descriptor leak in path_to_fshandle. A file
	  was being opened but never closed, regardless of
	  whether that descriptor was being cached. Now close
	  the file on error or if it is not being cached.
	- Fix xfs_repair handling of a corrupt v2 directory with
	  multiple entries having the same name.

xfsprogs-2.6.10 (05 April 2004)
	- Fix botch in recent addition of new superblock field
	  (features2) which could result in filesystems with v2
	  logs being created with invalid superblock fields.
	  Thanks to Chris Pascoe for this fix.
	- Fix error when forcing a too-large v2 log stripe size
	  back to 32K.  Thanks to Chris Pascoe for this fix too.
	- Fix xfs_copy -d option so that it really does create a
	  duplicate filesystem (the log is duplicated too now in
	  that case, whereas previously a fresh log was created).

xfsprogs-2.6.9 (26 March 2004)
	- Update HFILES in xfsprogs/io/Makefile to package io/io.h

xfsprogs-2.6.8 (25 March 2004)
	- Fix xfs_db when dumping v2 dirs larger than the fsb size.
	- Several xfs_io additions - support for memory mapped areas,
	  multiple open files, expert mode (freeze, shutdown, error
	  injection, etc), fadvise (Linux-specific), allow user to
	  specify a create mode to open(2).
	- Fix xfs_bmap verbose mode stripe alignment information.
	- Fix typo on xfs(5) man page.

xfsprogs-2.6.7 (19 March 2004)
	- Fix up UUID library checks again, previous fix didn't work
	  for older versions of autconf.
	- Allow for future extensions to the XFS ondisk structure by
	  reserving an extra 32 bits in the superblock for feature
	  bits (update xfs_db to dump them).
	- Fix xfs_repair handling of version 2 directories with a
	  hole at the start.
	- Fix an endian bug in xfs_copy, when operating on allocation
	  groups with multi-level freespace btrees.
	- Ensure xfs_repair "dangerous" mode does not attempt to set
	  the device blocksize, this generates an error when target
	  filesystem is mounted readonly.

xfsprogs-2.6.6 (03 March 2004)
	- mkfs now opens the devices it's operating on with the
	  O_EXCL flag set, which is used by the Linux 2.6 block
	  layer to ensure concurrent access does not happen.
	- Allow xfs_io to operate on files from other filesystems,
	  with the XFS-specific commands unavailable in this mode.
	- Fix configure scripts to also search for a UUID library
	  in /usr/lib64 which is its home on AMD64/x86_64.

xfsprogs-2.6.5 (20 February 2004)
	- Fix up mkfs to ensure that the log size is a multiple of
	  the v2 log stripe size even if the log happens to be aligned
	  on a log stripe boundary (always check it).

xfsprogs-2.6.4 (17 February 2004)
	- Fix a few more libxfs/repair leaks.
	- Fix up some libhandle routines, add the open_by_fshandle
	  routine required by recent versions of xfsdump.

xfsprogs-2.6.3 (19 January 2004)
	- Merge Steve Langasek's work on the Debian installer
	  support for xfsprogs.
	- Add knowledge to xfs_db about the security namespace in
	  its extended attributes commands.
	- Sync up user/kernel source in libxfs and headers.
	- Fix a couple of compilation warnings.
	- Workaround for some versions of autoconf mishandling the
	  AC_CHECK_SIZEOF macro.
	- Fix a memory leak in libxfs, most noticable in xfs_repair.

xfsprogs-2.6.2 (17 December 2003)
	- Fix dev_t sizing issues in user tools - glibc uses a 64
	  bit number and XFS has a 32 device bit number, confusion
	  reigns.  Not much manipulates device numbers in the XFS
	  user tools though, hence hasn't really been seen before.
	  Thanks to Christoph for the patch.

	- Human-friendly xfs_io read/write bsize specifications.
	- Dump throughput and IOPs values after xfs_io reads/writes.

	- Sync up user/kernel source in libxfs, libxlog and headers.
	- Add new inode flags into xfs_db too.

xfsprogs-2.5.8 (12 September 2003)
	- Add missing options to xfs_db frag command one-line summary.
	- Add xfs_io commands for setting and clearing new inode flags
	  for immutable/append-only/sync/no-atime/no-dump.
	- Dump some other statfs fields in the xfs_io statfs commands.
	- Remove "test" mode from xfs_repair, only useful in xfs_check.
	- Fix problem in xfs_logprint where it was trying to continue
	  in the presence of a corrupt log when it shouldn't have.
	- Fix an incorrect assertion in xfs_logprint in regards to the
	  validity of the log start block.
	- Fix xfs_growfs (and hence xfs_info) to allow it to be given
	  either a mount point or a device in the mount table - it'll
	  figure it out and should do the right thing either way now.

xfsprogs-2.5.7 (29 August 2003)
	- Sync up user/kernel source in libxfs and headers.
	- Make xfs_copy a tad more portable, although work remains.
	- Add a "test" mode to xfs_repair and xfs_check which allows
	  for sparse (and hence extremely large) filesystem testing.

xfsprogs-2.5.6 (19 August 2003)
	- Fix a mkfs problem where it could exit inappropriately when
	  a large data volume stripe unit was either specified on the
	  command line or via querying the underlying volume manager.

xfsprogs-2.5.5 (07 August 2003)
	- Update xfs_io command to allow reading from non-XFS files.
	- Sync up user/kernel source in libxfs, libxlog and headers.
	- Update xfs_db and xfs_logprint commands to print new inode
	  flush iteration field.

xfsprogs-2.5.4 (23 July 2003)
	- Update xfs_io bmap command to report unwritten extent flag
	  if it is set on an extent (in verbose mode only).
	- Introducing xfs_copy.
	- Fix shell quoting problem in xfs_bmap script.

xfsprogs-2.5.3 (07 July 2003)
	- Update xfs_io commands which take user input in terms of
	  byte counts to now also allow unit prefixes like mkfs.xfs.
	- Tweak build to avoid unnecessary rebuilds of international
	  language files (if present), suggested by Steve Langasek.
	- Fix usage message in mkfs.xfs, it was out of date.
	- Fix some filesystem type detection code, in particular the
	  bfs probe code was broken for 64 bit machines (found by QA
	  test 032) and the hfs code was broken too (originally found
	  by Ethan Benson).  We now also detect hfs+ filesystems.

xfsprogs-2.5.2 (25 June 2003)
	- Fix xvm stripe detection in libdisk - pass correctly
	  sized structures to xvm ioctls.
	- Add pthread library checks into configure and build scripts
	  for work-in-progress on xfs_repair and xfs_copy.
	- Fix missing initialisation of stripe unit/width alignment
	  information during libxfs_mount.

xfsprogs-2.5.1 (23 June 2003)
	- Fix libdisk device driver (volume managers) detection code
	  used by mkfs, so that drivers with multiple majors are not
	  incorrectly processed.

xfsprogs-2.5.0 (18 June 2003)
	- Fix libdisk (and hence mkfs) code which warns on MD devices
	  with the clean flag not set, apparently this is not so wise.
	- Fix libxfs_device_zero to work with smaller-than-requested
	  write return values.
	- Fix error in xfs_io pwrite code with large request sizes.
	- Fix rounding-down-input problems in several xfs_io commands.
	- Changed mkfs.xfs default log size scaling algorithm slightly,
	  to create larger logs at smaller filesystem sizes by default
	  (thanks to Andi Kleen for the patch).
	- Enable support for sector sizes larger than 512 bytes.

xfsprogs-2.4.12 (02 June 2003)
	- Fix xfs_logprint handling of any version 2 log device.
	- Remove calls to exit in libhandle, propogate errors to
	  caller, and bumped libhandle version from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2.

xfsprogs-2.4.11 (30 May 2003)
	- Extract device sector size at mkfs time and issue warnings
	  if the requested filesystem sector size is too small.
	- Sync up user/kernel source in libxfs, libxlog and headers.
	- Skip realtime initialisation in libxfs mount path if the
	  caller is xfs_db, otherwise we get nonsense warnings.
	- Update xfs_io with a couple of additional commands.
	- Fix xfs_logprint handling of corrupt v2 log devices.

xfsprogs-2.4.10 (12 May 2003)
	- Fix a bug in mkfs - creating version 2 logs, an incorrect
	  stripe unit value was being passed to libxfs_clear_log.
	  All recent versions of xfs_repair will fix this, however,
	  because xfs_repair uses the correct stripe unit value.
	- Fix a bug in xfs_logprint, when dumping a corrupt log.
	- FreeBSD updates from Alexander Kabaev.
	- Large sector size updates for mkfs (disabled at the moment).

	- Sync up with aeb's mount source for filesystem detection.

xfsprogs-2.4.9 (03 May 2003)
	- Allow xfs_repair to run on read-only filesystems.

xfsprogs-2.4.8 (26 April 2003)
	- Rework configure.in to make use of shared macros.
	- Fix up #include lines to allow compilation of sources
	  with installed headers rather than local headers.
	- Fix botches in xfs_bmap shell script which prevented any
	  arguments being passed on to xfs_io (from Jan Derfinak).

	- Correct display of imaxpct in mkfs.xfs output.
	- Portability changes; including some code to support use
	  of several tools on Mac OS X (for Russell), ditto for
	  FreeBSD (from Russell); also did a simplistic backport
	  to IRIX (for me), so that I can run purify on some of
	  the tools.
	- See doc/INSTALL for more details on this.
	- Sync up user/kernel source in libxfs and headers.
	- Fix up some warnings when compiling libxfs on big endian
	  platforms.
	- Fix a configure.in botch which resulted in libreadline
	  always being used even when it was not asked for.
	- Fixed the configure.in script so that if gettext disabled,
	  we don't check for the gettext tools (and no longer fails
	  if they were not found).
	- Added the ability to specify a different user and/or group
	  to install as (previously, and still by default, root/root
	  were always used here).

xfsprogs-2.4.3 (27 March 2003)
	- Cleanups to the build process, in particular the automatic
	  rpm package generation Makefile and spec file template.
	- Makepkgs script can now propagate failures back from make.
	- Minor configure.in update to deal with readline libraries
	  which have not been linked correctly.

xfsprogs-2.4.2 (25 March 2003)
	- Added the xfs_io(8) command, an xfs_db(8) alike command
	  for testing and debugging the XFS file IO path.
	- Added an optional dependency on the GNU readline library
	  which is "off" by default and enabled with the configure
	  option --enable-readline=yes; it affects the interactive
	  tools only (xfs_db and now xfs_io).
	- Implemented xfs_bmap(8) as a shell script wrapper.
	- Documented the mkfs.xfs -f, -llogdev and -rrtdev options.
	- Corrected size check for realtime summary inode (not the
	  same as the realtime bitmap inode) in xfs_repair.

xfsprogs-2.4.1 (18 March 2003)
	- Fix error reporting when zeroing parts of the realtime
	  device in phase6 of xfs_repair.

	- Sync up user/kernel source in libxfs and headers.

xfsprogs-2.4.0 (06 March 2003)
	- Enable unwritten extents by default in mkfs.xfs.
	- Add a command to xfs_db to enable unwritten extents.
	- Add an option to xfs_admin to use the above command.
	- Add command to xfs_db to print out the currently enabled
	  feature bits and version number.
	- Make xfs_db slightly more robust in the presense of bad
	  ondisk data.
	- Rationalise some xfs_db superblock-related code and the
	  uuid command now checks for a dirty log before zeroing.
	- Add stripe alignment information to xfs_bmap.
	- Sync up user/kernel source in libxfs and headers.
	- Update man pages, fix a typo in the xfs_admin man page

	  with no data entries (merged from IRIX), includes several
	  handy comments sprinkled throughout this v2 dir code.
	- Fix an endian bug in the same area of code (v2 dirs, phase 6,
	  longform_dir2_rebuild_setup)
	- xfs_repair has additional checks for bad sector values now.
	- xfs_repair I18N changes.

	  sector sizes (still plenty more to do here too).
	- Tidy up libxfs functions which take a "flags" argument.
	- Sync up user/kernel source in lib{xfs,xlog} and headers.
	- Fixed incorrect use of XFS_FSB_TO_DADDR macro in xfs_db's
	  faddr.c::fa_dirblock routine - now use XFS_FSB_TO_BB here,
	  as set_cur() takes basic blocks as its third parameter.
	- Fixed obscure issue in mkfs where only the first AG would
	  get its AGFL freelist "fixed" - not clear this caused any
	  issues in practice (on Linux it's always been this way, we
	  now match up with IRIX though).
	- Made xfs_growfs filesystem geometry output match up with
	  that displayed by mkfs.xfs (xfs_growfs was missing a comma
	  before the log version field).
	- Fixed an issue in xfs_repair where data past the end of the
	  valid superblock fields was sometimes not cleared, when it
	  really should have been (due to a libxfs problem).
	- Shell scripts (xfs_info, xfs_check, etc) now also report
	  the xfsprogs version number via -V, like other commands.

xfsprogs-2.3.7 (14 November 2002)

	- Sync up user/kernel source in lib{xfs,xlog} and headers.
	- Fix mkfs (libxfs) bug when using BLKFLSBUF ioctl - we passed
	  in the device number instead of a file descriptor (and EBADF
	  was the end result, which we ignored).
	- Thanks to Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org> for fixing this.

xfsprogs-2.3.4 (04 October 2002)
	- Fix size calculation bug in xfs_repair's memory allocation,
	  reduces memory usage by a factor of 4.

xfsprogs-2.3.3 (16 September 2002)
	- Fix mkfs bug when optimizing AG size on striped devices,
	  ASSERT(agcount != 0) tripped on single-ag filesystems.

xfsprogs-2.2.2 (19 August 2002)
	- Fix endian bug in xfs_db, was not flipping 16-bit numbers.
	- Make xfs_repair recognize a NULLFSINO and print that in
	  addition to "18446744073709551615" for easy recognition.
	- Fix format string that xfs_repair uses when fixing inodes,
	  so that the new inode numbers are printed correctly.

xfsprogs-2.2.1 (09 August 2002)
	- Fix buglet in libdisk get_driver_block_major() routine which
	  would result in incorrect majors being returned for not-found
	  drivers.
	- Fix problem in install process with newer autoconf versions.

xfsprogs-2.2.0 (08 August 2002)
	- mkfs.xfs defaults to a blocksize of 4096 bytes, and no longer
	  uses getpagesize(2) to dynamically configure the default size.
	- Add EVMS stripe unit/width auto-detection support in mkfs.xfs
	  (patch from Luciano Chavez).
	- Sync user/kernel headers (arch.h incorporated into xfs_arch.h,
	  and several other minor changes).

xfsprogs-2.1.2 (17 July 2002)
	- Fix up log stripe unit specification options, and update
	  man page.  Also fix suffix handling for data su/sw options
	  (disallow unit suffixes on -d sunit,swidth,sw and -l sunit).

	- Automatically select v2 logs if a log stripe unit is
	  specified.

xfsprogs-2.1.1 (04 July 2002)
	- Build infrastructure updates so that configure options can be
	  used to specify paths rather than semi-hard-coded path names
	  controlled by the ROOT/ROOT_PREFIX environment variables; eg.
	  now allows /lib64 and /lib32

xfsprogs-2.1.0 (14 June 2002)
	- Support for XFS version 2 log format.
	- Fix for xfs_repair mangling i8count for dir2_sf directories

	- Fix the way mkfs.xfs round downs the device when the last
	  AG is smaller than the minimum AG size.
	- Fix bug in xfs_repair da_write() routine, which affects
	  filesystems where the data blocksize != naming blocksize
	  (see xfs_info output).
	- Fix a use-after-free bug in xfs_repair code for checking
	  version 1 btree-format directories.
	- Add checks of the ACL permissions field into xfs_repair.

	- Size AGs so that they do not always start on the same
	  part of a striped disk
	- Fix an off-by-one error on rounding down an AG that is
	  too small to be an AG
	- Don't auto-grow the log to be larger than an AG
	- Change the error philosophy for -d su=,sw= away from forcing
	  the XFS stripe size to match the volume manager stripe size
	  and instead accept, with a warning, the stripe unit & width
	  supplied on the commandline.
	- Update xfs_growfs man page
	- Don't build libxlog.a with DEBUG enabled
	- xfs_db fixes from ASANO Masahiro at NEC

	  swabbing in libxfs code)

xfsprogs-2.0.3 (13 April 2002)

	  tripping asserts in additional libxfs debug code.

xfsprogs-2.0.2 (04 April 2002)
	- Bumped version of libhandle to libhandle.so.1.0.1
	  This changes open_by_handle() and friends so that

	  2^31-1 bytes instead of not dumping the large
	  files and giving warning messages.

	  uncertain_inode AVL trees ("avl_insert: duplicate range")
	- xfs_repair fix if the log is corrupted and we can't find
	  the head, don't exit - just proceed on with zeroing it
	- use snprintf instead of sprintf throughout

	  (restricting inodes to 32 bits) - Steve's recent kernel
	  changes mean this is no longer an issue

xfsprogs-1.3.13 (25 October 2001)
	- fix bug in mkfs for 1Tbyte + filesystems

	  userspace (libxfs), all affected code is removed by cpp.

xfsprogs-1.3.12 (17 October 2001)
	- implement the -f (file) option to xfs_logprint
	- rework the xlog code into libxlog for code sharing

	  lvdisplay program to get volume geometry (mkp@mkp.net)
	- fix bug in LVM driver wrapper where it would not have been
	  used at all, ever (since 1.3.0), due to idiot programmer
	  error (*blush*) -- also thanks to mkp for the bug fix

xfsprogs-1.3.7 (10 September 2001)
	- enable preallocation in xfs_mkfile [missed during port?]
	- fix xfs_db core dump when reporting freespace
